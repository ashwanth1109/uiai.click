# Frontend Deployment Strategy Analysis

## Problem Statement
Determine the best approach to deploy the Next.js frontend alongside the existing AWS SAM backend infrastructure, considering maintainability, security, and operational efficiency.

## Option Analysis

### Option 1: Extended SAM Template (Hybrid Approach) ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**

**Implementation:**
- Add S3 bucket and CloudFront distribution to existing `backend/template.yaml`
- Create separate `scripts/deploy-frontend.sh` for build and sync process
- SAM manages infrastructure, script handles deployment

**Architecture:**
```
SAM Template: Infrastructure (S3 bucket, CloudFront, IAM policies)
Deploy Script: Build process (npm build + aws s3 sync)
Integration: Script reads SAM stack outputs for bucket name/URLs
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Infrastructure as Code for AWS resources
- ✅ Flexible build process outside CloudFormation
- ✅ Single AWS account/profile management
- ✅ Easy environment variable injection (API endpoints)
- ✅ Independent frontend deployments without full stack update
- ✅ Proper separation: infrastructure vs deployment process
- ✅ Rollback capability (CloudFormation for infra, S3 versioning for assets)

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Two-step deployment process
- ⚠️ Script dependency for full deployment

### Option 2: Pure SAM Template

**Implementation:**
- Everything in `template.yaml` including build hooks
- Use SAM build hooks or custom resources for frontend build

**Pros:**
- ✅ Single deployment command
- ✅ Full infrastructure as code

**Cons:**
- ❌ CloudFormation not designed for build processes
- ❌ Complex custom resources needed
- ❌ Slower deployments (rebuild on every CloudFormation change)
- ❌ Limited build customization
- ❌ Hard to debug build issues

### Option 3: Separate Infrastructure

**Implementation:**
- Separate SAM template for frontend infrastructure
- Separate deployment scripts

**Pros:**
- ✅ Complete separation of concerns
- ✅ Independent scaling of complexity

**Cons:**
- ❌ Multiple CloudFormation stacks to coordinate
- ❌ Complex cross-stack references
- ❌ More operational overhead

## Recommended Implementation: Option 1

### Infrastructure Components (SAM Template)

```yaml
# S3 Bucket with security best practices
FrontendBucket:
  Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
  Properties:
    BucketName: !Sub '${AWS::StackName}-frontend-${Environment}'
    VersioningConfiguration:
      Status: Enabled
    PublicAccessBlockConfiguration:
      BlockPublicAcls: true
      BlockPublicPolicy: true
      IgnorePublicAcls: true
      RestrictPublicBuckets: true

# Origin Access Control (modern replacement for OAI)
OriginAccessControl:
  Type: AWS::CloudFront::OriginAccessControl
  Properties:
    OriginAccessControlConfig:
      Name: !Sub '${AWS::StackName}-oac'
      OriginAccessControlOriginType: s3
      SigningBehavior: always
      SigningProtocol: sigv4

# CloudFront Distribution with security and performance
CloudFrontDistribution:
  Type: AWS::CloudFront::Distribution
  Properties:
    DistributionConfig:
      # Security and performance optimizations
      # SPA routing support (404 -> index.html)
      # Proper caching policies
```

### Deployment Script Features

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/deploy-frontend.sh

# 1. Build Next.js application with environment variables
# 2. Get S3 bucket name from SAM stack outputs
# 3. Sync built assets to S3 with proper cache headers
# 4. Invalidate CloudFront distribution
# 5. Output deployment URL
```

### Security Best Practices
- Origin Access Control (OAC) instead of deprecated OAI
- HTTPS-only distribution
- Security headers via CloudFront response headers policy
- S3 bucket blocks all public access (CloudFront-only access)
- Proper CORS configuration for API calls

### Performance Optimizations
- CloudFront edge locations globally
- Optimized caching policies for static assets vs HTML
- Compression enabled (gzip/brotli)
- HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 support
- Regional edge caches

### Environment Management
- Environment-specific resource naming
- API endpoint injection at build time
- Separate S3 buckets per environment
- Environment-specific caching strategies

### Rollback Strategy
- S3 bucket versioning for asset rollback
- CloudFormation rollback for infrastructure
- CloudFront invalidation for immediate updates
- Blue/green deployment capability via script

## Implementation Benefits

1. **Best of Both Worlds**: Infrastructure as code + flexible deployment
2. **Security**: Modern AWS security practices (OAC, security headers)
3. **Performance**: Global CDN with optimized caching
4. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of infrastructure vs deployment
5. **CI/CD Ready**: Script-based deployment integrates well with pipelines
6. **Cost Optimized**: Pay-per-request DynamoDB, efficient CloudFront pricing

## Next Steps
1. Extend SAM template with frontend infrastructure
2. Create deployment script with environment variable handling
3. Test deployment process with staging environment
4. Document deployment procedures in context/
